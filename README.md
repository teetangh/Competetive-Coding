# Competitive-Coding

This repository contains my various implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms as well as some foundational C++ practice programs.

It also contains various my solutions to problems asked in various Competitive Coding Sites, Events and Platforms.

# ⭕⭕⭕⭕SUMMARY OF FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS

```
prog001xyz = only one file (NO CONFLICTS)
prog001n_xyz = new
prog001TLE_xyz = TLE
prog001WA_xyz = WRong Answer

prog001h_xyz = helped
prog001a_xyz,prog001b_xyz,prog001c_xyz,prog001d_xyz,...... = accepted versions
```

actually, i looked at some of my files after 2 months, i was confused which one was complete , incomplete, TLE , WA , etc...

One more important thing is that I dont make multiple files for naive , efficient , optimised solutions,rather i make 3 separate functions like:

```
solve_problem()
solve_problem_efficient()
solve_problem_optimised()
```
